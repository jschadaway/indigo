<p>Hello there! My name is Chamath Dharmasiri (though I occasionally go by the creative
alias "Jake Schadaway"), and I'm a software developer and recent undergraduate 
of Boston University. My long-term goals include creating look development 
software for film and gaming industry artists and researching new techniques 
for computer graphics. Most of my prior experience comes from writing frontend 
code for various open-source desktop applications, though I have recently begun 
studing both OpenGL and GLSL.</p>

<p>See my <a href="/projects">projects page</a> for a more detailed 
view of my previous experience.</p>
