Pylet is a basic development environment for creating, managing, and tracing Python code. It is intended to be as simple as possible to accomodate students and other learning individuals.

Pylet is primarily built on the Qt framework - interaction with the Python interpreter is handled through a singleton instance of a Python console whose standard input and output is redirected to the Qt console. Previously, I used the Boost Python libraries to access Python internals; later in development, I began to learn more about the Python C API and thus opted to include Python headers from whatever local installation of Python existed on the host machine. Because it uses Python's underlying C API, Pylet has access to some unique possibilities, such as profiling the memory of the child Python process.

Future work for Pylet includes moving the Python interpreter to a separate thread from the GUI thread - this would enable the interpreter to continue running when the window is moved, and allow Ctrl-C termination to directly target the Python console instead of the application as a whole.
