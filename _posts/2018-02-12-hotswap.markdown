This was a team project that I worked on as part of the Mobile Application Development class at Boston University. We had originally conceived of an idea where people could "swap" items that they did not regularly use with one another; however, as we began actually implementing the idea, we opted to focus on making the application a renting platform. Users could list an item with a given prices per day, and set the available dates on which it could be rented. My personal contribution to the project was primarily in the Stripe (payment) API integration, as well as UI / frontend design and outlining the overall strategy for moving an item between owned, rented, and "pending return" states. As part of the class goals, each of us cycled through supervision of the project in weekly Scrum cycles.
