Here you'll find various renders done by myself over the past four years; these served as the primary promotional material for the WesterosCraft server, which seeks to rebuild the world of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series in Minecraft (I also separately manage a project to transfer the world into a different game engine). As such, the builds represented here are not my own works. These massive models were first exported to Cinema4D and rendered with V-Ray, with some postprocessing done in Photoshop.
